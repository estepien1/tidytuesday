**1. What is the range of age differences between characters in Woody
Allenâ€™s movies?**

``` r
age_gaps |> 
    filter(director == "Woody Allen") |>
    select(age_difference) |> 
    range()
```

    [1]  4 40

The range of age differences is 4-40 years.

2.  **What is the mean age difference between characters in Woody
    Allenâ€™s movies across the years?**

``` r
age_gaps |> 
    filter(director == "Woody Allen") |> 
    select(movie_name, release_year, age_difference, couple_number) |>
    count(movie_name, sort = TRUE)
```

| Magic in the Moonlight |   1 |
| Scoop                  |   1 |

Out of 20 movies directed by Woody Allen in this data set, 6 movies have
entries detailing the age difference between more than one couple.
Therefore, it would be helpful to know the mean age difference of all
couples in each movie to make data visualisation easier.

``` r
age_difference_WA_movies <-
age_gaps |> 
    filter(director == "Woody Allen") |> 
    select(movie_name, release_year, age_difference, couple_number) |>

3.  **Visualising how age difference between characters in Woody Allenâ€™s

This table shows all Woody Allenâ€™s movie names and their release years.
It would be helpful to merge it with one of the earlier tables showing
mean age difference scores for all of these movies.

<!-- Now joining these two data frames together. -->

``` r

    merge(x = character_mean_age_difference_WA_movies,
                y = age_difference_WA_movies_clean,
                by = "movie_name") |>
    arrange(desc(release_year))

<!-- This data frame now includes all movie titles, their release year, and mean age difference between included couple characters. -->

Now itâ€™s possible to visualise the mean age difference between
characters in Woody Allenâ€™s movies across the years.

``` r
WA_mean_age_plot <- 
    WA_character_age_difference |>
    ggplot(aes(release_year, mean_age_difference, colour = movie_name)) +
    geom_line() + 
    geom_point(size = 3, show.legend = TRUE) + 
    expand_limits(x = c(1970, 2020),
                                y = c(0, 30)) + 
    labs(x = "Movie release year",
             y = "Mean age difference between love characters",
             title = "Age difference between love characters in Woody Allen's films (1977-2016) \nover the years",
             colour = "Movie name")

WA_mean_age_plot
```

    `geom_line()`: Each group consists of only one observation.
    â„¹ Do you need to adjust the group aesthetic?
