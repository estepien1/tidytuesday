# Tidy Tuesday

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains files documenting my attempts at solving [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges.

This projects provides a new dataset/challenge every week to support the development of data wrangling and visualisation skills among coding enthusiasts. Some of the packages I have used to solve weekly challenges include *ggplot2* and *lubridate.*
